An automatic ham sandwich maker uses a set of programmed ingredients to make sandwiches. First, users
select the size of the sandwich, then the machine determines how much resources are available before
making it. The user receives a message if there are insufficient resources. Otherwise, the user must pay
for sandwich by coins. The machine will indicate if insufficient coins are inserted or if there is an exchange
amount when coins are inserted. Also, on the screen, users can view the remaining resources report and
turn off the machine.
